This project is to develop Dating app and Dog app by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
So I utilized the following APIs to develop these apps;
üëâ randomuser.me
üëâ dog.ceo

ü•á Dating App
A score indicating the user's number of "swipes"/likes clicks. The user starts with 10 swipes/like clicks, and it will decrease by -1 each time the user swipes left or right on a user.
Three buttons: one for filtering women, one for filtering men, and one for both.
(There are only genders for women and men in the API today.) The user can click on these buttons to choose to only display either women, men, or both.
One card at a time shall be displayed on the website with information about a random profile that matches the user's filtering criteria. The following information shall be displayed about a profile:
Image, name, location
The cards shall have a distinct styling depending on whether it is a man or a woman on the card.

ü•á Dog App
‚úî A display of 10 profile cards. Each card shall contain:
‚óè Image of a random dog from the dog API, as well as image, name, and
location of a random profile from the randomUser API.
‚óè Delete button to delete a card
‚óè Chat button
‚úî A button with "Show 10 new cards". If this button is pressed, the previous 10 cards shall disappear and be replaced with 10 new ones.
‚úî Each card shall contain a delete button. The card shall be deleted from the website if it is pressed, and replaced with a new one. There shall still be 10 cards on the website.
‚úî A filtering function to filter based on dog breed. You must choose at least 5 dog breeds that the user can filter by. If the user filters by dog breed, only the cards with these dog breeds shall appear on the website. The cards shall contain the same information as the others, except for the delete button. Filtered cards cannot be deleted from the list, and there may be fewer or more than 10 cards on the page at a time.
‚úî If the user clicks on the chat button, a chat box shall open. The chat box shall allow the user to write messages to the owner of the dog on the card.
‚úî If the user clicks on one of the cards, a speech bubble shall appear next to thecard, displaying a random greeting from the dog. The random greetings you can get are:
"Woof woof", "Grrr!", "Meow??", "Woof!", "Woof woof woof", "WRAFF!!!"
